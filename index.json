[{"categories":null,"contents":"\n Prometheus Science is an Open Science consultancy  As an active member of the Open Science community over the last 10 years, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken special interest in open science hardware, as I believe they are one of the last barriers to make research and education truly open.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been developing tools and organizing workshops to teach others to do the same, the goal of Prometheus Science is to offer these skills as a service for a wider community, that sees the benefits of open source tools, but either doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to learn the necessary skills to implement them, or would like to receive tailored training in order to be able to develop open source tools in the future.\nMy services include:\n Open Source / Open Science Hardware workshops. Open science tools development. Open science tools replication.  I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to share knowledge and expertise around open tools and how to make research and education more accessible!\nGet in touch using the form\nAndr√© Maia Chagas\n","permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":"Prometheus Science Consultancy"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/categories/","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/tags/","tags":null,"title":"Tags"}]
