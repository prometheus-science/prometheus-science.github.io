I've been developing tools and organizing workshops to teach others to do the same, the goal of Prometheus Science is to offer these skills as a service for a wider community, that sees the benefits of open source tools, but either doesn't have the time to learn the necessary skills to implement them, or would like to receive tailored training in order to be able to develop open source tools in the future.     My services include:  Open Source / Open Science Hardware workshops. Open science tools development. Open science tools replication.      I'm looking forward to share knowledge and expertise around open tools and how to make research and education more accessible!
